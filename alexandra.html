			<!-- Here Alex cut out my intro and write your own, it should serve as an intro
			to your porfolio. Mine is not a good example as my page isn't much of a portfolio
			but you get the idea. -->
			<p>Welcome to my Portfolio! The following are my favorite pieces that I've created throughout the last couple years. 
			Although art has mainly been a hobby of mine, when college applications rolled around I decided to give it a proper try. Portfolio
			requirements and class assignments were the cause of a massive increase in art production during my senior year, but I'm incredibly
			proud of what I've created during that period.</p>
			<p>I so excited to continue studying art at Boston University and expand my portfolio over the next four years!</p>

		<h2>Materials</h2>
		<p class = "section1">The materials I work with</p> <!-- IDK change this to whatever makes sense-->

		<h5>Paper!</h5>
		<p>When creating my pieces, I prefer to use watercolor paper or bristol paper. My two favorite kinds of paper are
		<a href="https://www.fabriano.com/en/22/artistico_traditional_white" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Fabriano Watercolor Paper</a>
		and
		<a href="https://www.strathmoreartist.com/draw-bristol.html" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Strathmore Bristol Paper</a>
		</p>
		<h5>Colored Pencils!</h5>
		<p> My preferred medium is colored pencil, and although I use a lot of different brands, here are my favorites! 
<a href="https://www.carandache.com/ch/en/luminance-6901-s-1090.htm?utm_source=google_ads&utm_medium=Paid_Search&utm_campaign=paid_search_br_ge_US%2FBR%2FG%C3%A9n%C3%A9rique&gclid=CjwKCAjwn8SLBhAyEiwAHNTJbRWXMzeoStCNafHPZN6M7tnA5Cqg3qi675-tmrv1kFaR65IFjqfj8xoCGhoQAvD_BwE" style = "text-decoration: underline;">
Caran d'Ache Luminance Colored Pencils </a>
		and
		<a href="https://www.prismacolor.com/colored-pencils" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Prismacolor Colored Pencils</a>
		</p>
		<h5>Paints!</h5>
		<p>
			Although I'm not a big painter, I sometimes find myself using paints along with other mediums for 
			some of my projects. When I do end up using paint, I like to use
		<a href="https://www.liquitex.com/us/products/basics/range/colors/" style = "text-decoration: underline;">
			Liquitex Basics Acrylic

		<p>As my first semester at BU comes to a close, I'd like to highlight the work I've been creating
		in my foundational drawing class.</p>
		<p>The primary focus of this drawing class is to create all of our compositions without value, only using line.
		This was initially very challenging for me, especially because I am so comfortable with colored pencil! Luckily I 
		was able to overcome this and have recently been incredibly content with the work I've been creating </p>
		<p> The drawing pictured was a two-session drawing, each session being 3 hours in class. Having a live model is something
		I never had the opportunity to experience during highschool, and it definitely has helped me grow as an artist. </p>
		<p> I can't wait to continue creating and seeing where these classes take me!</p>
