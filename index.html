	<p>What do a Math (and Econ) major, CS Major, and Graphic Design Major have in common?
	Academically speaking, there isn't much overlap. We all have our own academic paths, whether we 
	are only beginning or nearing the end. Come explore our portfolios, and see what academic diversity
	we have to offer. Each page is dedicated to one portfolio for the three of us. We encourage 
	you to explore them all, but also understand if you would like to avoid the Math major's portfolio. </p>
